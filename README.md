## Project Description

What makes a playlist popular?

Can we quantify what makes a playlist popular? Is there something inherent about the qualities of the songs or the behavior of the listeners? This project aims to predict the popularity of playlists by using public data and the Spotify API in order to determine what might make someone's playlist "popular". In this case, popularity would be measured by the followers of the playlist, with predictors being a variety of playlist and song characteristics including the length of the playlist, duration of the songs, the "energy level"/"dancability" of each song, the popularity of artists, the listen time, etc. Will you be able to determine the next hit playlist?

Motivated students may find it appropriate to use the Spotify API to gather more information.
